# ExpressAPI

This project is a simple **Node.js + Express** application that acts as a **proxy API** for a remote **.NET API** hosted at  
[`https://isabelladaoodapi.azurewebsites.net/`](https://isabelladaoodapi.azurewebsites.net/).

It allows users to **fetch** and **create** product data through endpoints that forward requests to the external .NET API.
